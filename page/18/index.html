		<p>Dear Cutie,</p>
<p>I thought perhaps you might be able to shed some light on something that I can&#8217;t get a handle on.</p>
<p>Despite having a great life, I struggle with anxiety.Â I think it is mostly due to my mom being sick for the bulk of my life (and dying when she was 54) that I have such anxiety about my health. I am SO SCARED of every little twinge, ache, pain, itch, mole.</p>
<p>Right now, I am extremely anxious about a mole on my face. I have seen my doctor, and she says I have nothing to worry about. Despite this, she has referred me to a dermatologist, who will likely say the same thing. My appointment with him is November 30th, and I have decided that this mole has to go, regardless of whether it looks bad or not. Â </p>
<p>However, until then, I have to learn to deal with the anxiety over something that gives me no real good reason to be anxious about.</p>
<p>Do you have some words of advice? Â I feel like I can&#8217;t overcome this recurrent anxiety. I feel like this is my kryptonite, my achilles heel.</p>
<p>Signed,<br>
Nerves</p>
<p>Dear Nerves,</p>
<p>I know that you think you are upset about your health, but you might also be upset about something else in your life. Have you considered talking to your doctor about all the stress you are having? Doctors are familiar with this kind of thing and may have some good direction for you to take.</p>
<p>Anxiety can be overwhelming, but I have found that the best way to navigate it is to focus on taking care of yourself. Join a gym and work out your anxiety with exercise. Write in your journal. Take a soak in the tub (don&#8217;t forget the bubbles!). Talk on the telephone. Watch a good movie. </p>
<p>And instead of worrying, try to spend some time listening. To God, if you believe. To the wind, if you like that kind of thing. Just try to sit still and &#8220;be&#8221; without giving in to worry. It is your mind, and you can control it if you find the right tools.</p>
<p>I will think good thoughts for you and I trust that you will do what you can to take care of yourself.</p>
<p>Love,<br>
Cutie<br>

		<p>Dear Cutie,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a 42 year old woman. Married late, tending to my career. And after five years, I realize that I have never successfully transitioned from a romantic phase into a less passionate but stable phase. Now, as my husband has successfully transitioned, I am miserable and once again unable. To me, my needs aren&#8217;t being me. </p>
<p>But I am now wondering if, perhaps I am just not the marriage type. I just can&#8217;t get past the hump, into accepting a bland, passionless, existence. I&#8217;d rather be alone than suffer that for extended lengths of time. Â </p>
<p>What&#8217;s my next step. Why can&#8217;t I be happy in long-term relationships?</p>
<p>Signed,<br>
Yearning</p>
<p>Dear Yearning,</p>
<p>Romance is important, but that excitement does dwindle unless you build a foundation for your relationship. I&#8217;m sorry to hear you describe your life as a bland and passionless existence. That reminds of my mantra: &#8220;If you are bored, you are boring.&#8221;</p>
<p>The good news is that you can turn things around. Take some time to identify your values and consider what you want out of your life. A relationship is important, but it starts with you. If you can make your life more satisfying, and share activities that you feel passionate about with your partner, I think the romance you are missing will not be far behind.</p>
<p>Love,<br>
Cutie</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Dear Cutie,</p>
<p>I am eighteen, and I am dating a man who is quite a bit older than me &#8212; he is 35. We&#8217;ve been together for less than a year. He wants to settle down &#8212; marry me and have children, eventually &#8212; and so do I. He&#8217;s the love of my life and I don&#8217;t want to be without him. </p>
<p>Other people criticize the age difference, but I don&#8217;t think of it as a problem. Honestly, I think I might subconsciously see him as somewhat of a father figure. My father was very cold to me and I&#8217;m an only child and I&#8217;ve always wanted an older brother, and I kind of feel like he fixes that. Is that weird? I don&#8217;t want to sound pathetic. He&#8217;s the most gentle, kind man I&#8217;ve ever known. He makes me feel so good and I feel so lucky to be with him. </p>
<p>We rushed into the relationship, moving in together, and talking about marriage and children, but it feels so right. Â </p>
<p>Is it wrong that I&#8217;m dating an older man when I&#8217;ve had issues with my father and issues with not having a male role model?</p>
<p>signed,<br>
Young Lady</p>
<p>Dear Young Lady,Â </p>
<p>I hate to to say it, because it is what everyone says, but this man is too old for you. You are only eighteen. You have your whole life ahead of you.Â </p>
<p>I&#8217;m so glad that you have found the support you have needed in him, but that does not mean that you have to start thinking about marriage and children.</p>
<p>Give yourself a chance to think it over. Go out with your girlfriends.Write in your diary. Figure out who you are and what you want.Â Remember you are not in a rush.</p>
<p>Good luck to you and I hope you make the decision that feels right for you.Â </p>
<p>Love,<br>
Cutie</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Dear Cutie,</p>
<p>My husband has been unemployed since October. He is smart and a good good person. Â We have only been together for about two years. </p>
<p>We have a couples counselor who suggested we sell our house to relieve the financial pressure. At first I said yes, but now I am not willing to do it. I feel like I have been struggling to find a solution to all our financial and relationship problems, and although he says he is trying and believes he is doing everything he can do, I still feel like everything is on me. </p>
<p>We are not actually married, and the mortgage is in my name only. We do really have a family together though and my daughter thinks of him a Â father, and the house is in both our names.</p>
<p>I love him dearly and I know he loves me. What do you think I should do?</p>
<p>Signed,<br>
On the Ropes</p>
<p>Dear On the Ropes,</p>
<p>I know that you are comfortable in your home, but I think it is time to downsize. You can be happy without your home. You can be happy to live within your means. This is the kind of thing that can become a big problem. And it is not worth the stress. Take this opportunity to create a life that is sustainable and happy for you and your family.</p>
<p>You and your husband will continue to work hard to provide a beautiful living situation and not feel so chained by circumstance. Change is scary, but it when you take that first step that you open yourself up to a world that you never could have dreamed of. Don&#8217;t be afraid. Keep loving your husband, and let him love you back. Support him in his search for a job.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to carry this burden all on your own. And you will still be you even if your life looks a little different.</p>
<p>Good luck to you.</p>
<p>Love,<br>
Cutie<br>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Nibbler&#8217;s in the new place in town. It has taken over for the Denny&#8217;s behind Union Station. I&#8217;m rushing to give this review, because I learned that they are switching back to Denny&#8217;s because the sales aren&#8217;t as competitive. I learned this news when I stopped in for blintzes this morning and, boy will I be sad to see them go, because Nibbler&#8217;s offers a wider variety of options than Denny&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Their blintzes happen to be very good. And they share the menu with other popular Jewish items such as lox, bagels and cream cheese and matzo ball soup. I have not tried the lox or the matzo ball soup. I actually don&#8217;t even like lox because I don&#8217;t eat fish, but I&#8217;m happy to know it is on the menu. Even if I don&#8217;t eat these items, I can try to make my family eat them.  </p>
<p>There are a few things you need to know about Nibbler&#8217;s. It run by the same management and it looks exactly like Denny&#8217;s, but without the signage. In fact, they spruced things up a bit by decorating the stone walls with different colors and that is the kind of touch I appreciate. They also offer free items if you come at the right time. I won&#8217;t tell you that I&#8217;d take the free Philly cheese steak sandwich, mostly because I don&#8217;t like that kind of sandwich and because I&#8217;d feel embarrassed to take a free meal and leave. But the fact that they offer this service makes me think they are considering the customer.</p>
<p>And after my years of running a shoe store, I&#8217;ve learned a thing or two about customer service. That is really what matters when it comes down to it. Food is food. Sometimes it is a little better. Sometimes it is a little more authentic. But the customer service is the asset that really earns a restaurant a place in my heart.</p>
<p>My family happens to like Nibbler&#8217;s and we&#8217;ve made it our new spot. We will try to go a few times before they switch back to Denny&#8217;s and stop serving the flannel cakes and the fresh-squeezed orange juice. The staff is very attentive but they seem sad about switching back to Denny&#8217;s. I think there is more freedom when you are your own boss and that is nice but you really can&#8217;t argue with name recognition. When the Denny&#8217;s sign is back, I&#8217;ll fondly remember the brief but wonderful spell when we had Nibbler&#8217;s in our lives.<br>

		<p>Dear Cutie,</p>
<p>I have been married for four years, had sex three times, and I am just at the breaking point, My husband said that he had a medical problem about three years ago, but has done nothing about it. Don&#8217;t you think that if it really mattered to him, he would have taken care of it by now?</p>
<p>Signed,<br>
Unfulfilled</p>
<p>Dear Unfulfilled,</p>
<p>You should talk to his doctor, together. </p>
<p>If he is not satisfying you, you could get your marriage annulled. Or this could be the beginning of a conversation. Ask him what is wrong and don&#8217;t take excuses for an answer. Also, tell him that there is not enough intimacy in the relationship to keep you going. </p>
<p>This is a difficult situation, but you shouldn&#8217;t have to settle. You deserve to feel fulfilled in all ways, including sexually. By allowing him to continue this way, you are showing him that you tolerate this lifestyle, when in fact you may not be willing to do so. Please do not wait passively, but act to find out if there is a real marriage worth saving in your home. Good luck to you.</p>
<p>Love,<br>
Cutie<br>

		<p>Dear Cutie, </p>
<p>I need your advice please. This may sound silly, as I am 23, but I feel so lost on what to do. My boyfriend of over a year broke things off three weeks ago. I love him very much, but I didn&#8217;t always treat him right. I didn&#8217;t cheat on him or anything. I never meant to hurt him, but I grew up in a dysfunctional home and have a hard time communicating.  I miss him more than words can say. He refuses to talk to me, but I have been able to leave him alone this last week. </p>
<p>I found out he&#8217;s been taking some girl out. I&#8217;m so hurt! We had been together over a year! What should I do? I really want to fix things and heal the hurt. What should I think about this new girl? My ex is not a jerk, so I can&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s moved on so fast! I feel sick all the time and cry. I just want him back. He was my best friend. Please help me.</p>
<p>Signed,<br>
Heartbroken</p>
<p>Dear Heartbroken,</p>
<p>He has moved on and I suggest you do the same. The best thing you can do right now is to move on with your life. Pick up a new hobby, call your girlfriends. I know that it is hard and this is an important relationship to you, but you can&#8217;t force something if the other person is not interested. This is a great opportunity for you to address the challenges you feel because of your childhood. I know how difficult that can be, but if you don&#8217;t look at these things, they will stick with you and end up causing more problems. </p>
<p>A relationship is important. But the relationship you have with yourself is even more important. The stronger you get, the healthier you&#8217;ll be and the healthier your relationships will be. It sounds to me as if you need to work on yourself before you can be a good partner to another person.</p>
<p>You can still care about him, but it hurts to chase someone who is not interested. And there are fish in the ocean. Go out and swim again, and with time, you will find someone else who you think is wonderful, and who wants to be with you.</p>
<p>Love,<br>
Cutie<br>

		<p>Dear Cutie,</p>
<p>I have been best friends with three girls for the past two years. If you&#8217;ve seen the &#8220;Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants&#8221; movies, it&#8217;s like that. </p>
<p>One of my friends had become distant, but only from me. She has this new boyfriend. She randomly accused me of trying to take him from her, and trying in the past. I&#8217;ve tried to explain to her on multiple occasions I would never do that. She shuts me out. </p>
<p>I logged onto Facebook recently only to discover that she deleted me after not talking to me for months. You could say it was like a slap in the face. I tried emailing her to work it out. In the long run she just wanted to hurt me, and admitted to it, because she doesn&#8217;t trust me. </p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t know what I did wrong. I went along with her ignoring me, then I tried to apologize. Nothing seems to work. I don&#8217;t want to fight back or lose her. What should I do?</p>
<p>Signed,<br>
Totally Alone</p>
<p>Dear Totally Alone,</p>
<p>She is involved with her boyfriend and she has made her position clear. You have made efforts to improve the situation and talk about it, but she is not interested.</p>
<p>I think that you should stop reaching out to her. If she cannot show you respect, then she doesn&#8217;t deserve to be in your life. You are not desperate for friends. You may have a history with this woman, but that does not give her a pass to treat you this way.</p>
<p>There are wonderful people out there who are not interested in these games and they want to be your friend. I know this hurts now, but things will get better the less you are involved with this relationship.</p>
<p>Love,<br>
Cutie<br>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Dear Cutie,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been married almost 18 years and have six wonderful children, all home, 6-19, all very well mannered and make me proud daily. The problem is on the outside we look great, but on the inside I&#8217;m dying. I want out sooo bad but I don&#8217;t know what to do. Do I just sleep in a separate bedroom until the baby grows up or do I get out now? I don&#8217;t love him, I don&#8217;t even like him. We barely talk unless its about the kids or his or my comings and goings. I miss being in love!</p>
<p>We were separated for almost a year (last year) and I made the biggest mistake I think by letting him back into the house. Nothing has changed. If anything, it&#8217;s gotten worse for me. I want to move out, but I have no job, plus the kids need me. Having him move out will be tough because he said last time we could barely afford it!</p>
<p>But please know he doesn&#8217;t abuse me &#8212; it&#8217;s just I feel silenced. He has said what I say doesn&#8217;t matter, ever! That it&#8217;s trivial to him. It scares me that my kids are seeing him act like this and learning this behavior. I have three girls and three boys, all of them very impressionable </p>
<p>So my question to you is: do we move into separate bedrooms and just deal with it and just exist until the baby grows up, or do we get out while we still can and have a chance at finding real love elsewhere?</p>
<p>Miss Cutie, if it weren&#8217;t for my kids I&#8217;d be gone, so please help me.</p>
<p>Signed,<br>
Silenced</p>
<p>Dear Silenced,</p>
<p>It sounds like you are completely overwhelmed and in a unhappy situation. Changing your life drastically might help, but people usually say that their problems follow them around. I think that you need to take some time to learn how you can take care of yourself.Â </p>
<p>If you want things to get better in your life, you are going to need support. Have you considered going to therapy and talking about your problems? If the two of you can go that would be best, but even if he will not, you can get some benefit.</p>
<p>There are ways you can make small changes in your life that can have a great impact. And after you&#8217;ve had some time to really assess your situation, you can come up with a plan that feels right. Maybe you will stay with this guy if things improve. Or maybe you just are not interested. That is a big decision, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be rushed.Â </p>
<p>Go spend some time with your girlfriends. Be honest about your feelings and lean on them. Reach out to new friends. Join a community church. There are many things you can do to improve your situation and it will be come clear what is the right course of action.Â </p>
<p>It is great that you reached out and shared some feelings. They may not feel wonderful but they are putting you in a good direction to turn your life around.Â </p>
<p>Finally, I disagree that you are not being abused. Being told that what you think and say is trivial is emotional abuse. You have a right to demand something better than this from somebody who is supposed to love you. So in therapy, you can learn about what is normal and what is abnormal, and what you are willing to accept in your home.</p>
<p>Take care of yourself and good luck.Â </p>
<p>Love,<br>
Cutie</p>
