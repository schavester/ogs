					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;This is such a difficult&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such a difficult subject for those who know about it and for those who do not understand it.  Schizophrenia is a disease, one that unfortunately for the one diagnosed with it, sometimes will not admit that they have, which makes it hard on the loved ones around trying to help.  
Cutie is right, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.  It&#039;s difficult to be compassionate when the person does not want/cannot help themselves.  I feel for you, my relationship with my Mother has deteriorated since she has become ill too.  There is no right or wrong. Find the compassion at the little times you can but do not beat yourself up for things you cannot change.
