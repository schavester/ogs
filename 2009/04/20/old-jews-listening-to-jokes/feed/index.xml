					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;Old Jews...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi,

I&#039;m truly pleased that my site inspired you to record your grandparents responding to a few old chestnuts. It&#039;s a delight to watch and although mine are not still around, it gives me a fairly good idea of how they probably would have responded.

Maybe, when we come shoot in LA, you&#039;d like to have them tell a joke for our cameras?

best
