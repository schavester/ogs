I can&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good afternoon Cutie.


I can not wait to get stuck into your book.

I read your article in Glamour magazine and on the Guardian website. For clumsy, hopeless romantic old fashioned girls like myself, your book is great value, common sense in an overly technical world with too many &quot;do&#039;s &amp; don&#039;ts&quot;.

THANK YOU.]]></description>

You remind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elyse Malmquist
You remind me so much of my mother that it is unbelievable!  I love you!  Can I call you grandma?  My mom was born 11/8/1917 is Chicago, IL and lived an exciting life in Hollywood, CA all the way to the San Fernando Valley (Encino) and then met her last husband in Oceanside where she was in a car accident in March 15, 2005.  She passed away at Cedars Sinai Memorial Hospital, in L.A. and I really miss her!  She would have loved you so much!  God Bless you you sweet and beautiful woman! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;This is such a difficult&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such a difficult subject for those who know about it and for those who do not understand it.  Schizophrenia is a disease, one that unfortunately for the one diagnosed with it, sometimes will not admit that they have, which makes it hard on the loved ones around trying to help.  
Cutie is right, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.  It&#039;s difficult to be compassionate when the person does not want/cannot help themselves.  I feel for you, my relationship with my Mother has deteriorated since she has become ill too.  There is no right or wrong. Find the compassion at the little times you can but do not beat yourself up for things you cannot change.
