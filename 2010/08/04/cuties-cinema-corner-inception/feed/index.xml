&lt;strong&gt;Good news! One of our nice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news! One of our nice fans, Yael, volunteered to help transcribe some of the OGs videos for closed captioning, and the first one is now online at the link below. Just click the CC button under the video to activate the captions. We hope to get more online soon.

&lt;strong&gt;We&#039;re so sorry about&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#039;re so sorry about that--we know Cutie is quite soft spoken, and do all we can to make it easy to hear her. We did experiment with Youtube&#039;s automatic closed captioning with a recent video and while we left the results online, they were NOT what anyone would call a success. Right now we just don&#039;t have the time to transcribe what&#039;s said in the videos, so you&#039;ll just have to be patient with us... and turn your speakers up. Thanks for watching and listening, despite the challenges!]]></description>
