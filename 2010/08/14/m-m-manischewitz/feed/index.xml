You remind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elyse Malmquist
You remind me so much of my mother that it is unbelievable!  I love you!  Can I call you grandma?  My mom was born 11/8/1917 is Chicago, IL and lived an exciting life in Hollywood, CA all the way to the San Fernando Valley (Encino) and then met her last husband in Oceanside where she was in a car accident in March 15, 2005.  She passed away at Cedars Sinai Memorial Hospital, in L.A. and I really miss her!  She would have loved you so much!  God Bless you you sweet and beautiful woman! :)]]></description>
